# httpcats-server

a docker container which serves the http cats from https://http.cat/

## why?

because I want to use these error pages with traefik but cloudflare blocks traefik on the offical site 

## usage

1. run the docker container
1. access photos of cats on http://${HOST}/${HTTP-ERROR-CODE}.jpg
1. enjoy
